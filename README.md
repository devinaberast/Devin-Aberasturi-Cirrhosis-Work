# Devin-Aberasturi-Cirrhosis-Work
All the work I completed for Dr. Tapper's research on Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) at University of Michigan during 2018-2019 school year. Made for future workers who want to look at the work I have completed.

Includes the following:

Code for Final Dataset, a dataset used in all of the modeling codes;
Codes for all the modeling and survival curves I made;
Also includes code for summary table on statistics for each group;
Includes supporting documents to understand variables and the results of the models;

To know more about variables, look at data dictionary.

To know more about what models were done, look at model descriptions.
